This utility diffs two complete resman views.  We support two modes of operation:


Diffing against another language in the same repository:

  Just give the language path component to compare as the only argument (i.e. "de").
  The lefthand-side language will be "en", unless overriden by --language.
  Resman-modifying parameters like --keys and --erfs will apply to *both* sides.

  Example:
    $0 --keys nwn_base lang de  (This should show no differences)


Diffing against another install (no other-language support yet):

  The lefthand side will be set up by the builtin resman flags and options,
  like --keys. The RHS only supports autdetect for now.
  Hint: Give --verbose to see what exactly gets loaded into either.

  Example:
    $0 path ../00810            (diff to NWN 1.69, auto-detected)


This utility will explicitly ignore .wav files that:

- are binary mismatches
- are in only one or the other side: This is *expected* as translations were
  never completely complete

Give --wav to override this.

Usage:
  $0 [options] lang <lang2>
  $0 [options] path <path> [keyfiles]
  $USAGE

Options:
  --write-mismatches          Write out mismatches to a directory. Warning:
                              This will potentially be a LOT of data.
  --wav                       Include wav files in diff considation.
